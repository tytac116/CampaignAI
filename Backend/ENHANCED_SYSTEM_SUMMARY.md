"Show best     Analysis         Monitor → Analyze → Report
 campaigns"    (confidence: 0.9)

"Pause low     Action           Execute Actions → Report
 CTR campaigns" (confidence: 0.95)

"Create summer Hybrid           Monitor → Analyze → Actions → Report
 campaign"     (confidence: 0.8)
```

## 🧪 **Multi-Agent Coordination Examples**

### **Example 1: Intelligent Campaign Creation**
```
User: "Create a summer tech conference campaign for Facebook with $2000 budget"

Flow:
1. Intent Analysis → "hybrid" (research + action)
2. Web Search → Current tech conference trends
3. Content Generation → Optimized campaign materials
4. Campaign Creation → Database insertion with generated content
5. Report → Comprehensive creation summary
```

### **Example 2: Performance-Based Actions**
```
User: "Pause all campaigns with CTR below 2%"

Flow:
1. Intent Analysis → "action" (database changes required)
2. Campaign Listing → Filter by CTR < 0.02
3. Bulk Operation → Pause matching campaigns
4. Report → Changes made and affected campaigns
```

### **Example 3: Budget Reallocation**
```
User: "I have $1000 unallocated. Find the best campaign and increase its budget"

Flow:
1. Intent Analysis → "action" (analysis + database changes)
2. Performance Analysis → Identify top ROAS campaign
3. Budget Update → Increase budget by $1000
4. Report → Justification and changes made
```
