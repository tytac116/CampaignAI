Focused Workflow Test: Validate Enhanced Campaign Analysis

This test validates that the enhanced workflow:
1. Provides direct, specific answers to questions
2. Identifies specific campaigns by name
3. Provides campaign-specific recommendations
4. Uses web search when beneficial
5. Avoids generic fluff and focuses on the actual question

Test Question: "Analyze the top 3 campaigns with the lowest click-through rate and generate a report 
with recommendations on how to improve them, including budget optimization and identified problems 
compared to other campaigns."
